# Image Gallery

## What's this?

An image gallery implemented in React. With async loading of the images and infinite scroll. The images are randomly consumed from Flickr.

## Usage
The solution is divided in two different aplications: **app** and **api**. You need to install and run both at the same time for getting it to work.

### API

#### Installation
Open the terminal and go to the 'api' folder
```
cd api
```

```
npm install
```

#### Run the application
```
npm run start
```
### APP
#### Installation
Open another terminal and go to the 'app' folder
```
cd app
```
Install dependencies.
```
npm install
```

#### Run the application
```
npm run start
```

#### Navigate to:
```
localhost:8080
```
